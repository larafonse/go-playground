# Go programming languange

## Overview 
- Go tries to reduce the amount of typing
- created at google
- open source
- go syntax is influenced by C and C-style languages
- emphasizes greater simplicity and consision in syntax
- strongly typed languange
- go to solution for developers who build solutions fot cloud-based services
- based on mostly C
- implements many OOP concepts:
  - encapsulation with types and structs
  - polymorphism with interfaces
- designed to be the next-gen language for C
- Borrows some syntac from C
- Borrows from the family of Pascal, Modula, and Oberon Languanges

examples of projects to build in go:
- command like routine
- web based applications
- system programs
 
## Essential Characteristics
- Compiled languange
- statically typed languange
- Go tool can run a file without precompiling
  - application is bieng compiled to a temporrary executable
- Kinda Object-Oriented 
  - you can define custom interface
- custome types can implement one or more interfaces
- custome types can have member methods

## Not Supported by Go
- Type inheritance
- Method or operator overloading
- Structured exception handling
- Implicit numeric conversion
